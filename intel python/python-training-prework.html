<h1 id="pre-training-preparation">Pre-training Preparation</h1>
<p>Python is a cross-platform language and works equally well on Windows, Linux and OS/X. Python also comes with an interactive console that allows one to quickly try out a construct. Most of the example code in the training slides can be directly entered into this console and immediately tested by the participant.</p>
<p>The canonical Python installation is from the Python website (https://www.python.org). Visit this site and download the latest version of Python for your OS. A better distribution is Anaconda Python, with lots of useful modules pre-packaged. This can be found at https://www.anaconda.com. Alternatively, you can also download the Intel Distribution for Python which contains many Data Science libraries optimized for Intel Architecture processors. (https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python) From a command line (DOS prompt) run python. This should open an interactive console. Alternatively, you can use a program called IDLE which gets installed with Python, to open an interactive console.</p>
<h2 id="nice-to-have">Nice to Have</h2>
<p>There are many nice IDEs for Python as well. You can try installing any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyCharm Community Edition (http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)</li>
<li>Install the programming editor Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the python extensions.</li>
<li>Spyder IDE which provides a nice Development Environment for scientific computing. (https://www.spyder-ide.org/)</li>
<li>Pyzo (https://pyzo.org/)</li>
<li>For a nice command line interactive environment with Intellisense-like code completion environment, you can install ptpython (https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython) by typing the following command on the command prompt: pip install python</li>
</ul>
